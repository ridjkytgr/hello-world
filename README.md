# hello-world
My first repository

Hi!
I'am Ricky, the creator of this repository and this readme files
Pardon me for my not-very-good-english, cause i'm currently practicing my English until it reaches profesional proficiency level.

Oh and also, i'm currently studying at University of Indonesia, majoring in Computer Science.

Nice to meet whoever you're that read this file :D
